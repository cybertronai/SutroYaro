## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-04

### Research experiments (Round 2 — autonomous agent team)

- **Sign SGD** — solves k=5 2x faster than standard SGD (7 vs 14 epochs). Surprise: standard SGD also solves k=5 with enough data (n_train=5000). The exp_d "failure" at 61.5% was insufficient data, not algorithm limits.
- **Curriculum learning** — n=50/k=3 cracked via n=10→30→50 transfer. 14.6x speedup. Transfer after W1 expansion is instant (1 epoch). Biggest practical finding of the session.
- **Cache-aware MemTracker** — built CacheTracker with LRU simulation. L2 (256KB) eliminates all misses for both single/batch. Batch wins on total traffic (13% fewer floats, 16x fewer writes), not cache locality. Single-sample is more L1-friendly.
- **Weight decay sweep** — WD=0.01 already optimal. Working range is narrow [0.01, 0.05]. Higher WD kills learning.
- **Per-layer + batch** — combines but not valuable. Single-sample SGD is 8x faster in epochs. Per-layer re-forward adds 3.7x overhead.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-04

### Research experiments (Tasks A-F)
- **Exp A: ARD on winning config** — per-layer gives 3.8% ARD improvement on 20-bit (17,299 vs 17,976). W1 dominates at 75% of all float reads, capping reorder-based improvements at ~10%.
- **Exp B: Batch ARD** — batch-32 does 16x fewer parameter writes but shows 17x higher ARD in our metric. The metric doesn't model cache. On real hardware where W1 fits in L2, batch training would be far more efficient. Need cache simulation in MemTracker.
- **Exp C: Per-layer on 20-bit** — per-layer forward-backward converges identically to standard backprop (99.5%, same epoch count). Free 3.8% ARD improvement with zero accuracy cost.
- **Exp D: Scaling frontier** — standard SGD breaks at n^k > 100,000 iterations. k=3 works up to n~30-45. k=5 is categorically impractical (~200,000 epochs for n=20). This is where novel algorithms matter.
- **Exp E: Forward-Forward** — solves 3-bit (100%) but fails 20-bit (58.5%). Has 25x WORSE ARD than backprop. The "local learning" advantage is illusory for 2-layer networks.
- **Exp F: Prompting strategies** — documented the literature-search → diagnose → experiment workflow that took us from 54% to 100%.

### Speed
- **`fast.py`**: numpy-accelerated training solves 20-bit in 0.12s average (220x faster than pure Python). hidden=200, n_train=1000, batch=32.

### Infrastructure
- LAB.md — protocol for autonomous Claude Code experiment sessions
- DISCOVERIES.md — accumulated knowledge base from all experiments
- `_template.py` — copy-and-modify experiment starter

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Exp 1: Fix Hyperparams** — 99% accuracy on 20-bit sparse parity (k=3). Changed LR 0.5→0.1, batch_size 1→32, n_train 200→500. Classic grokking: stuck at 50% for 40 epochs, then phase transition to 99% in ~10 epochs.
- **Exp 4: GrokFast** — counterproductive. Baseline SGD hits 100% in 5 epochs (22.7s). GrokFast took 12 epochs and never reached 100%. The bottleneck was wrong hyperparams, not the optimizer.
- Literature review: 6 key papers (Barak 2022, Kou 2024, Merrill 2023, GrokFast, NTK grokking, SLT phase transitions)
- Research plan for autonomous experiment cycle
- Results organized into per-run directories with auto-generated index
