## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-07

### Phase 2: 17 experiments + Practitioner's Field Guide

**Phase 2 experiments** dispatched 17 independent Claude Code agents in parallel, each testing a different algorithmic approach:

- **Algebraic/Exact**: GF(2) Gaussian elimination (509 us, 240x faster than SGD), Kushilevitz-Mansour influence estimation (ARD 1,585, 724x better than Fourier), SMT backtracking
- **Information-Theoretic**: Mutual Information, LASSO, MDL Compression, Random Projections -- all solve it, none beats Fourier meaningfully
- **Local Learning Rules**: Hebbian, Predictive Coding, Equilibrium Propagation, Target Propagation -- all failed at chance level (parity requires k-th order interaction detection)
- **Hardware-Aware**: Tiled W1 (software ARD worsened), Pebble Game (2.2% energy savings), Binary Weights (fails at n=20)
- **Alternative Framings**: Genetic Programming (exact formula but doesn't scale), RL Bit Querying (ARD of 1 at inference), Decision Trees (greedy splitting can't find secret bits)

**Practitioner's Field Guide** (`docs/research/survey.md`): 4,500-word survey ranking all 33 experiments with decision framework, 10 generalized principles, and full AI research methodology.

**Telegram sync tooling**: `sync_telegram.ts` pulls messages from Sutro Group topic threads via MTProto. Full setup guide in docs/tooling/automation.md.

Updated DISCOVERIES.md, mkdocs nav (survey + 17 findings pages), and research index.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-04

### Blank-slate approaches (Round 3, no neural nets, no SGD)

Rounds 1-2 were incremental variations on the same MLP+SGD recipe. Round 3 reframes the problem: sparse parity as a **search problem**, not a learning problem.

For k=3 parity with secret indices {a,b,c}, the label is `x[a] * x[b] * x[c]`. You don't need a neural network. You need to search over C(n,k) possible subsets and test which one matches the data.

- **Fourier / Walsh-Hadamard solver**: Sparse parity IS a Fourier coefficient. For each candidate k-subset S, compute `mean(y * product(x[:, S]))`. The true secret gives correlation ~1.0, everything else gives ~0. No training, no gradients, no iterations. Result: **13x faster than SGD** (0.009s vs 0.12s for n=20/k=3), solves n=50/k=3 and n=20/k=5 trivially where SGD struggles. Only needs 20 samples. Scales to k=7 before combinatorial explosion (C(n,k) subsets).

- **Evolutionary / random search**: Randomly sample k-subsets, test if `product(x[:, subset])` matches all labels. For n=20/k=3 it takes ~881 random tries (0.011s). Evolutionary search with mutation+crossover solves it in fewer evaluations but more wall time. Solves n=50/k=3 in 0.14s, a config SGD fails on entirely.

- **Feature selection**: Tried to decompose into "find the bits" then "classify." Exhaustive combo search works (178-1203x fewer ops than SGD). But the clever approaches fail: pairwise correlations are provably zero for parity (E[y * x_i * x_j] = 0 for ALL pairs, even correct ones). Greedy forward selection also fails. Parity has **zero low-order statistical signatures**. You must test the full k-way interaction. Neural nets need so many iterations because they implicitly search the combinatorial space via gradient descent.

**When to use what**:
- k ≤ 7: Fourier/random search wins (milliseconds, exact, guaranteed)
- k ≥ 10: C(n,k) explodes, SGD's implicit search via gradients becomes the only feasible path
- k = 8-9: hybrid approaches may work (combinatorial search with pruning)

### Research experiments (Round 2, autonomous agent team)

Round 2 explored variations on the working SGD solution: different optimizers, hyperparameter sweeps, and energy measurement improvements.

- **Sign SGD**: Replace gradient with its sign: `W -= lr * sign(grad)`. Normalizes gradient magnitudes, helping detect sparse features. Solves k=5 2x faster than standard SGD (7 vs 14 epochs). Standard SGD also solves k=5 with enough data (n_train=5000). The exp_d "failure" at 61.5% was insufficient data, not algorithm limits.
- **Curriculum learning**: Train on easy configs first, then expand the network. n=10/k=3 (instant) → expand W1 with zero-padded columns → n=30/k=3 (1 epoch) → n=50/k=3 (1 epoch). Result: 14.6x speedup, cracks n=50 which direct training can't. The learned feature detector transfers because new columns start near zero.
- **Cache-aware MemTracker**: Built CacheTracker with LRU cache simulation to fix the broken ARD metric. Finding: L2 cache (256KB) eliminates ALL misses for both methods. Batch wins on total traffic (13% fewer floats, 16x fewer writes), not cache locality. Single-sample is more L1-friendly than batch.
- **Weight decay sweep**: Swept WD across [0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0]. WD=0.01 already optimal. Only [0.01, 0.05] achieves 100% success rate. The effective LR*WD must be in [0.001, 0.005], an extremely narrow range.
- **Per-layer + batch**: Combined per-layer forward-backward with mini-batch SGD. Converges but not useful: single-sample SGD is 8x faster in epochs, and the per-layer re-forward pass adds 3.7x wall-time overhead.

### Research experiments (Round 1, measuring energy on the working solution)

With 20-bit solved, round 1 asked: how energy-efficient is our solution, and can we improve it?

- **Exp A: ARD on winning config**: Measured energy proxy (ARD) on the working config. Per-layer forward-backward gives 3.8% improvement (17,299 vs 17,976 floats). W1 (the big weight matrix) dominates at 75% of all float reads, capping operation-reordering improvements at ~10%.
- **Exp B: Batch ARD**: Batch-32 shows 17x higher ARD in our metric, but does 16x fewer parameter writes. The ARD metric doesn't model cache. On real hardware where W1 fits in L2, batch would win. This exposed a limitation of our measurement tool.
- **Exp C: Per-layer on 20-bit**: Update each layer before proceeding to the next. Converges identically to standard backprop (99.5%, same epoch count). Free 3.8% ARD improvement with zero accuracy cost.
- **Exp D: Scaling frontier**: Mapped where standard SGD breaks. k=3 works to n~30-45. n=50/k=3 fails (54%). k=5 is impractical at any n (~200,000 epochs for n=20). The boundary is at n^k > 100,000 iterations, matching the theoretical SQ lower bound.
- **Exp E: Forward-Forward**: Hinton's local learning algorithm (no backward pass). Solves 3-bit but fails 20-bit (58.5%). Has **25x WORSE ARD** than backprop, opposite of hypothesis. The locality advantage requires 10+ layer networks; our 2-layer MLP is too small to benefit.
- **Exp F: Prompting strategies**: Documented the meta-workflow: literature search → compare against published baselines → diagnose the gap → fix → verify. The most effective prompt was asking Claude to compare our hyperparams against Barak et al. 2022.

### Speed
- **`fast.py`**: numpy-accelerated training solves 20-bit in 0.12s average (220x faster than pure Python). hidden=200, n_train=1000, batch=32.

### Infrastructure
- LAB.md: protocol for autonomous Claude Code experiment sessions
- DISCOVERIES.md: accumulated knowledge base from all experiments
- `_template.py`: copy-and-modify experiment starter

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-04

### Solving 20-bit sparse parity

The pipeline from v0.4.0 got 54% accuracy on 20-bit, a coin flip. Literature review of 6 papers diagnosed the gap.

**The problem was hyperparameters, not the algorithm.** Our LR=0.5 was 5x too high (literature uses 0.1), we used single-sample SGD instead of mini-batch (batch=32), and had too little training data (200 vs 500+ samples). One arxiv search fixed all of it.

- **Exp 1: Fix Hyperparams**: Changed LR 0.5→0.1, batch_size 1→32, n_train 200→500. Result: 99% accuracy with classic grokking, stuck at 50% for 40 epochs, then phase transition to 99% in ~10 epochs. The hidden progress metric ||w_t - w_0||_1 grew steadily throughout, confirming Barak et al. 2022's theory.
- **Exp 4: GrokFast**: Tested the EMA gradient filter from Lee et al. 2024 (amplify slow gradient components to accelerate grokking). Counterproductive. With correct hyperparams, baseline SGD hits 100% in 5 epochs (22.7s). GrokFast took 12 epochs and never reached 100%. Lesson: don't apply tricks designed for one regime (extended memorization) to another (fast convergence).
- Literature review: 6 papers (Barak 2022, Kou 2024, Merrill 2023, GrokFast, NTK grokking, SLT phase transitions)
- Research plan for autonomous experiment cycle
- Results organized into per-run directories with auto-generated index
