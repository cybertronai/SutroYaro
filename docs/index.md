# SutroYaro

Research workspace for the **Sutro Group**, focused on energy-efficient AI training. Weekly meetings at South Park Commons (SF).

## Status: Sparse Parity Challenge SOLVED

20-bit sparse parity (k=3, 17 noise bits) solved at **100% accuracy in 0.12 seconds** across 5 random seeds. 16 experiments completed across 3 rounds.

!!! success "Results"
    - **LR=0.1, batch=32, hidden=200**: correct hyperparams were the main fix, not the algorithm
    - **Per-layer forward-backward** gives 3.8% ARD improvement for free
    - **Curriculum learning** (n=10→30→50) gives 14.6x speedup, cracks n=50
    - **Forward-Forward** has 25x worse ARD than backprop, not viable for small networks
    - **For small k, sparse parity is a search problem**: Fourier/random search is 13x faster than SGD

!!! info "Energy"
    Memory access dominates training energy cost. Local registers cost ~5pJ vs HBM at ~640pJ, a 128x difference.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Solve 20-bit sparse parity in 0.12s
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m sparse_parity.fast

# Run the full pipeline (3 training variants, ARD comparison)
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m sparse_parity.run

# Run your own experiment
cp src/sparse_parity/experiments/_template.py src/sparse_parity/experiments/exp_mine.py
# Edit, run, record findings
```
