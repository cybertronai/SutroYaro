# Tooling

How we use Claude Code as a research automation tool for the Sutro Group.

## The Stack

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| [Claude Code](claude-code-setup.md) | AI coding agent in the terminal — runs experiments, writes findings, manages the MkDocs site |
| [CLAUDE.md](claude-code-setup.md#claudemd) | Project instructions file that gives Claude context about the repo |
| [Skills](skills.md) | Reusable workflow templates (anti-slop, brainstorming, TDD, debugging, etc.) |
| [Anti-slop guide](anti-slop-guide.md) | Reference for eliminating AI writing patterns from prose |
| [Automation scripts](automation.md) | `sync_google_docs.py` for pulling Google Docs, reference extraction |

## What Worked

The combination that produced 16 experiments in a few days:

1. **CLAUDE.md as shared context** — Every Claude Code session starts by reading the project state, findings, and working style rules
2. **LAB.md as experiment protocol** — Enforces one-hypothesis-per-experiment, baselines, and commit discipline
3. **Anti-slop on all prose** — Keeps documentation readable by humans, not just LLMs
4. **Parallel agents** — Multiple Claude Code instances running independent experiments simultaneously
5. **Sub-2-second iteration** — `fast.py` (numpy) keeps the feedback loop tight enough for hundreds of experiments per hour

## What to Try Next

- MCP servers for direct Google Docs access (currently using export URLs)
- Hooks for auto-running experiments on file save
- Custom skills for the Sutro research loop (literature search, hypothesis, experiment, measure)
- Memory files for cross-session learning about what hyperparameters work
